your text cursor is blinking. If your text cursor is blinking, type
print(′Hello World!′) into the interpreter and press Enter.
>>> print('Hello World!')

Congratulations—you just wrote and ran your first line of
Python code! So, what exactly happened? The code you entered

another line of code using the same code as before; however,
replace Hello World! with another phrase. Be sure to keep
the quotes surrounding the phrase; otherwise, the interpreter
returns an error after you press Enter.
>>> print( ‘Python is awesome!’)
Python is awesome!
There are two important things to remember about running
Python code. First, Python code is run from top to bottom.
What this means is that the code that appears at the top of the
program is run first and the final line of the code is run last.
Second, Python relies on proper indentation. You will notice
later in this book that some of the code examples are indented.
Fortunately, IDLE automatically includes indentation for you.
However, it’s also helpful to be aware of how much you should
indent your code when necessary. If you need to manually
